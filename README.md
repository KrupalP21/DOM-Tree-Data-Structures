# DOM-Tree-Data-Structures

Using HTML, trees, stacks, recursion, and nodes to create a document object model tree (DOM) in Java. Project at Rutgers University-New Brunswick for Sesh Venugopal in CS112 Data Structures.

## Objective

Given a HTML text file perform various operations that will change, add or remove the contents in the document. Several helper methods are used and recursion is used intesley in order to create a correctly formatted DOM Tree. Completing a method called build() will create the DOM Tree and then the following options will allow the program to manipulate the DOM Tree. Options are:
```
h = html() //converts contents of tree into HTML
r = replaceTag() // replaces any tag in the tree with another
b = boldRow() // bolds one whole line of html and a node row in the tree
d = deleteTag() // deletes a tag and ensures the tree is still in correct format
a = addTag() // adds a tag in a location and ensures the tree still keeps correct format
q = quit() // ends program
```
Made using Eclipse(Java), and HTML
